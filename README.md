# Gossip Membership Protocol

This project is an implementation of the Gossip Membership Protocol, originally part of a distributed systems assignment from the University of Illinois (Coursera).

## Project Overview
The Gossip Protocol is used to maintain membership information in a distributed system by exchanging heartbeat messages between nodes.

## My Contributions
- Debugged and fixed issues in `mp1node.cpp` for node communication and failure detection.
- Successfully ran the provided scripts to validate and submit the assignment.
- Understood and experimented with the heartbeat and membership list mechanisms.

## How to Run
- Make sure you have a Bash shell environment (Linux, macOS, or WSL on Windows).
- Python 2 or 3 is required for submission scripts.
- Copy necessary files `run.sh`, `submit.py`, and `mp1-regen-data` to the project directory.
- Run the submission with:

```bash
python ./submit.py
